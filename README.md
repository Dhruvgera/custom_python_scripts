# python_custom_scripts
Python scripts written by me to automate ROM compilation and upload them. Will be adding more scripts for choosing which kernel to install while flashing ROMs soon!  

# compilation.py:
A python programme with some bash, can take basic inputs to create a personalised rom building programme for you. The programme can check for basic dependencies such as Device trees, Kernel trees and Vendor trees and clone them if they are not present and can set Ccache. It also has a functionality to keep checking when the ROM gets compiled and send it to ur Telegram through a bot(It needs a little bit of fixes). Hence, this can help newbies and experienced users as well!!!  

# build.py:
A python program, once again, but this time made for CerberusOS team so that they can compile stuff in one go!!!

# sftp.py:
A python program to find the largest file in your requested directory and automatic uploads to sftp clients such as sourceforge
